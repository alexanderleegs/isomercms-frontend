## IsomerCMS Frontend

This repo contains the source code for the IsomerCMS frontend. 

### How it works

The frontend is built using React and hosted on Netlify. The frontend interacts with the IsomerCMS backend server, which in turn calls GitHub APIs to modify code in the users' Isomer website repo.

### How to develop

```
source .env
npm install
npm start
```
